A simple notes application deployed on AWS Cloud - Accessible from any device and any where

This project involves the development of a cloud-based Notes web application, addressing the common issue of forgetting important information. The application allows users to create, edit, view, search, and delete notes securely from any device with internet access. By leveraging AWS for deployment, the app ensures that users can access their notes anywhere and anytime. The application includes user authentication and hashed password storage to protect sensitive information.

The Notes web app is designed to be accessible from any internet-enabled device, offering a free, cloud-based solution for note-taking. Users must register with their email, user ID, and password to access the app. The app allows users to create, edit, search, and delete notes, with all data securely stored and managed. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access their notes, with hashed passwords for enhanced security. Deploying the app on AWS ensures scalability, reliability, and global accessibility.
